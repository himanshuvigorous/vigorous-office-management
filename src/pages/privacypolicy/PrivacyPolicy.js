        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-black mb-3">Purpose and Usage</h2>
        <p className="mb-3">
          To avail certain HRMS and ERP features on the EasyMyOffice platform, users will be required to provide certain information during the registration process. This information may include:
        </p>
        <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 mb-3">
          <li className="mb-1">Email address</li>
          <li className="mb-1">First name and last name</li>
          <li className="mb-1">Phone number</li>
          <li className="mb-1">Date of birth</li>
          <li className="mb-1">Address</li>
        </ol>
        <p className="mb-3">
          In order to access specific HRMS features such as attendance tracking, payroll management, leave management, and employee self-service, users may be required to provide additional information such as their Employee ID or Tax Identification Number (TIN). This will help verify your identity and ensure access to the correct services and features.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-3">
          During the course of using the platform, users may also invite other employees or users ("Invited Users") to join and utilize the platform's services. The invitation may involve sharing the email address or phone number of the Invited User. EasyMyOffice may then contact the Invited User to invite them to register and participate in the relevant HRMS functionalities.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-3">
          By inviting others, the user agrees that they have obtained consent from the Invited Users for sharing their contact details and for EasyMyOffice to use this information solely for the purpose of inviting them to register and participate in the platform's services.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-3">
          The information provided by users is specific to the services they wish to access and will be used for providing a personalized and seamless experience with the platform. EasyMyOffice may also share this information with trusted affiliates and third parties, but only in specific cases such as:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-3">
          <li className="mb-1">Providing the services requested by the user (e.g., payroll processing, attendance reports, etc.)</li>
          <li className="mb-1">Complying with legal or regulatory requirements</li>
          <li className="mb-1">Ensuring the security and functionality of the platform</li>
          <li className="mb-1">Preventing fraud or preventing harm to users or the platform</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          EasyMyOffice takes privacy seriously and ensures that any data shared with third parties is used responsibly and securely.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-black mb-3">Use of Cookies</h2>
        <p className="mb-3">
          To enhance the effectiveness and usability of the EasyMyOffice platform for our users, we use cookies and similar electronic tools to collect information. These tools assign each visitor a unique, randomly generated User ID to understand individual preferences and interests while using the app.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-3">
          Unless the user voluntarily identifies themselves (e.g., through registration), easymyoffice.com has no way of knowing who the user is, even if we assign a cookie to the device. The only personal information a cookie can contain is the information voluntarily provided by the user during registration or while interacting with the platform. Cookies cannot access or read data from the user's device or hard drive.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-3">
          Additionally, advertisers or third-party services used by EasyMyOffice may also assign their own cookies to the user's browser when interacting with ad banners or third-party content. However, EasyMyOffice does not control these third-party cookies and their data collection practices.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-3">
          EasyMyOffice's servers may also collect limited information about the user's device connection to the internet, such as the device's IP address, whenever the user visits the platform. The IP address is a unique identifier that helps the platform deliver requested content, tailor the app's services to user preferences, track usage patterns, and provide useful insights for improving the app's overall user experience.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-3 font-semibold">
          Please Note: The user's IP address does not personally identify the user. This information helps EasyMyOffice:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-3">
          <li className="mb-1">Deliver content to the user efficiently</li>
          <li className="mb-1">Analyze traffic within the app</li>
          <li className="mb-1">Provide insights into geographic locations of app visitors</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          EasyMyOffice does not collect any personally identifiable information without the user's consent and ensures that all cookies and data collection methods are used in compliance with privacy policies.

        </p>
        <p className="mb-3">
          While we take data security seriously and implement strong safeguards, it's important to understand that no security system is entirely foolproof. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that data transmission over the Internet or storage on our servers will be 100% secure. Users are encouraged to take precautions, such as using strong passwords and logging out after sessions, especially when using shared devices.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-3">
          By using EasyMyOffice, you acknowledge and agree that your information may be processed, stored, or transferred outside your current location, including to servers located in other jurisdictions, where data protection laws may differ.

          As the internet and data security landscape continues to evolve, we may review and update our Privacy Policy and Security Procedures periodically. Any changes made will be posted on this page. Your continued use of the platform after such changes signifies your agreement to the updated policy.
